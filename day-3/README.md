This is Day 3, where I implemented Socket.IO for real time telemetry and data analytics for my IOT project. Basic event monitoring and connectivity is present and will be expanded upon later in the 100 Days. The goal is to have a startup script determine if an IOT server exists on the local network, if so it will enter client mode, else become the server.
