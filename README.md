# 100DaysOfCode
This repository will hold my 100 Days of Code which should run from June 11 of 2020 to September 19 2020

Day 0:  Created the git repository and README for all of the code. 
        Folder structure will be 1 folder per day starting at Day 1.
        This is not being counted as part of the 100 days.

Day 1:  Created working branch for day-1 and decitded on 
        using ReactStrap to quickly create responsive 
        components. The component I am working on will be
        used for the room information in an IoT project that
        will most likely be my focus for the next few months

Day 2:  Created then scrapped a react component for forms,
        implemented a slider that dynamically updates the 
        preferred temperature in the existing tile. Slider
        min, max and label is updated dynamically based
        off of the C/F toggle functionality
