# 100DaysOfCode
This repository will hold my 100 Days of Code which should run from June 11 of 2020 to September 19 2020

Day 0:  Created the git repository and README for all of the code. 
        Folder structure will be 1 folder per day starting at Day 1.
        This is not being counted as part of the 100 days.

Day 1:  Created working branch for day-1 and decitded on 
        using ReactStrap to quickly create responsive 
        components. The component I am working on will be
        used for the room information in an IoT project that
        will most likely be my focus for the next few months

Day 2:  Created then scrapped a react component for forms,
        implemented a slider that dynamically updates the 
        preferred temperature in the existing tile. Slider
        min, max and label is updated dynamically based
        off of the C/F toggle functionality

Day 3:  Implemented Socket.IO for real time telemetry and data analytics for my IOT project. Basic
        event monitoring and connectivity is present and will be expanded upon later in the 100 Days. The goal is to have a startup script determine if an IOT server exists on the local network, if so it will enter client mode, else become the server.

Day 4:  LeetCode Algorithm challenges in NodeJS backed JavaScript. Usually done in C++ using HackerRank
        so this was a nice change.

Day 5:  Block Diagramming for Raspberry Pi Zero W devices startup logic.

Day 6:  Monitor Model basic creation. Design of OUI filtering for startup logic.
